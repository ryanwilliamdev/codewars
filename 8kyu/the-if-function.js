/* INSTRUCTIONS
Create a function that takes three arguments:

    a value to be evaluated for truthiness.
    a function to execute if the first argument is truthy.
    a function to execute if the first argument is falsy.

If the first argument evaluates to truthy, call the second argument (a function). If it evaluates to falsy, call the third argument instead (also a function).

Note: The first argument can be any value, since most languages allow any value to be interpreted as truthy or falsy. In strongly typed languages, however, it will typically be a boolean.

// MY SOLUTION
function _if(bool, func1, func2) {
  if (bool) {
    func1()
  } else {
    func2()
  }
}
