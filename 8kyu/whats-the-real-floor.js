/* INSTRUCTIONS
Americans are odd people: in their buildings, the first floor is actually the ground floor and there is no 13th floor (due to superstition).

Write a function that given a floor in the american system returns the floor in the european system.

With the 1st floor being replaced by the ground floor and the 13th floor being removed, the numbers move down to take their place. In case of above 13, they move down by two because there are two omitted numbers below them.

Basements (negatives) stay the same as the universal level.
*/

// MY SOLUTION
function getRealFloor(n) {
  if (n > 13) {
    return n - 2;
  } else if (n <= 13 && n > 0) {
    return n - 1;
  } else if (n === 0 || n < 0) {
    return n;
  }
}


/*
Parameters: negative and positive whole integers
Return: return either a negative or positive whole integer
Example: if n === 1, return 0 (minus 1), if n === 15, return 13 (minus 2), 0 return 0, -n returns -n
Pseudo Code:
1. Need conditional if statement
  if > 13, return n - 2, 
  else if n <= 13, return n - 1
  else if n === 0, return 0
  else if n === -n, return -n
