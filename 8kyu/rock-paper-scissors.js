Let's play! You will be given valid moves of two Rock, Paper, Scissors players, and have to return which player won: "Player 1 won!" for player 1, and "Player 2 won!" for player 2. In case of a draw return Draw!.

// MY SOLUTION
const rps = (p1, p2) => {
  if (p1 === "scissors" && p2 === "paper") {
    return "Player 1 won!"
  } else if (p1 === "scissors" && p2 === "rock") {
    return "Player 2 won!"
  } else if (p1 === "paper" && p2 === "rock") {
    return "Player 1 won!"
  } else if (p1 === "paper" && p2 === "scissors") {
    return "Player 2 won!"
  } else if (p1 === "rock" && p2 === "scissors") {
    return "Player 1 won!"
  } else if (p1 === "rock" && p2 === "paper") {
    return "Player 2 won!"
  } else {
    return "Draw!"
  }
