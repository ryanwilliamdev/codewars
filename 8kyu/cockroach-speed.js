/* INSTRUCTIONS
The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

For example:

1.08 --> 30
Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.
*/

// MY SOLUTION
function cockroachSpeed(s) {
  return Math.floor(s * 27.778); // 27.778 is an approximate speed value conversion of km/hr to cm/s
}
