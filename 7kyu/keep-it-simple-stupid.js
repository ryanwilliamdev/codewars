/* INSTRUCTIONS
KISS stands for Keep It Simple Stupid. It is a design principle for keeping things simple rather than complex.

You are the boss of Joe.

Joe is submitting words to you to publish to a blog. He likes to complicate things.

Define a function that determines if Joe's work is simple or complex.

Input will be non emtpy strings with no punctuation.
It is simple if: the length of each word does not exceed the amount of words in the string (See example test cases)

Otherwise it is complex.

If complex:
return "Keep It Simple Stupid"
or if it was kept simple:
return "Good work Joe!"
*/ 

// MY SOLUTION
function isKiss(str) {
  const words = str.split(' ');
  const isSimple = words.every((word) => word.length <= words.length);
  return isSimple ? 'Good work Joe!' : 'Keep It Simple Stupid';
}
